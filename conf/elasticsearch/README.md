# Elasticsearch Configuration Files

By default ILM checks every 10 minutes if thereâ€™s any action to execute. In our example we had to use very small intervals (seconds, minutes), for testing.
Execute the following command to execute ILM

Test ILM policy

`{
    "name": "mediacloud-lifecycle-policy",
    "policy": {
      "phases": {
        "hot": {
          "actions": {
            "rollover": {
              "max_age": "10s"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "_meta": {
      "description": "built-in ILM policy using the hot phase with a rollover of 10s,
      "managed": true
    }
}
`

`
PUT _cluster/settings { "transient": { "indices.lifecycle.poll_interval": "15s"  } }
`
These configuration files are exported from the Elasticsearch host nodes as reference for the existing configuration.

To create a new Elasticsearch node configuration, refer to the script at `docker/elastic-deploy.sh`
